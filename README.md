# Assignment 01 – Conference Travel Decision Analysis

Student: Mateo Peter Zeppieri  

This repository contains my completed notebook for Assignment 01, which applies decision framing and optimization techniques to select conference travel options.

The analysis includes:
- Identification of decision variables and inputs  
- Objectives and constraints (hard and soft)  
- Tradeoff analysis with visualizations  
- A PuLP optimization model to minimize travel cost  
- Stakeholder considerations including per diem costs and baseball-specific recovery priorities

## Notes

The model prioritizes cost control while maintaining acceptable lodging quality and convenience.  
Stakeholder considerations were incorporated to demonstrate how additional priorities introduce tradeoffs between affordability and comfort/performance.
